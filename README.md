# **ESP32 RGB Web-Controller**
Firmware for ESP-32 to control RGB and Adress RGB strips via the web interface. Works only over Wi-Fi.

P.S. *I wrote this firmware for my DIY RGB controller on ESP32. If you want to add your own “Effects”, change something in the firmware or supplement it somehow, make a fork and create a Pull Request, I will be glad to see your ideas!*

## How it works
